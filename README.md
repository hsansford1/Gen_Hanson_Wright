This repository contains the code for "How high is `high'? Rethinking the roles of dimensionality in topological data analysis and manifold learning", Hannah Sansford, Nick Whiteley, Patrick Rubin-Delanchy. https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16879

The notebook `toy_example.ipynb` is standalone and can be run without any additional data.

To run the code in the other notebooks it is first neccessary to download and extract the data folder from this url:
https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Toroidal_topology_of_population_activity_in_grid_cells/16764508?file=35078602

The notebook `generate_data.ipynb` must then be run in its entirety before running `grid_cell_experiment.ipynb`.
